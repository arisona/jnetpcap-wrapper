# jNetPcap version 2
jNetPcap is a *libpcap* java binding. This is version 2 release of popular **jNetPcap** library, previously hosted on SourceForge.net.

**Note:** Compatibility with jNetPcap version 1
Version 1 of **jNetPcap** was released some 10 years ago. Version 2 has numerous backward incompatiblities with version 1, but overall version 1 libraries can be easily upgraded to version 2.

[Version 1  of **jNetPcap**][jnetpcap_v1_page], also bundled in a lot of functionality, that did not belong at the *libpcap* binding level. Version 2 corrects that, as all  extraneous functinality has been factored out into separate modules, of which development does not have any impact on the main **jNetPcap** stability or functionality.
