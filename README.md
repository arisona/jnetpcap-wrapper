# jNetPcap version 2
jNetPcap is a libpcap java binding. This is version 2 release of popular jNetPcap library, previously hosted on SourceForge.net.

**Note:** Compatibility with jNetPcap version 1
Version 1 of **jNetPcap** was released some 10 years ago. Version 2 has numerous backward incompatiblities with version 1, but overall version 1 libraries can be easily upgraded to version 2.

Also version 1 of jNetPcap bundled in a lot of functionality, that did not belong at the libpcap binding level. Version 2 aims to correct that, as all that extraneous functinality has been factored out into separate modules, which development does not impact main **jNetPcap** stability or functionality.
