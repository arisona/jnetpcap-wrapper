THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE ATTRIBUTION

jNetPcap uses several 3rd party open source software libraries:

* The libpcap portable packet capturing library from https://tcpdump.org
* The Winpcap packet capturing library. It has been abandoned, but is
  currently still available from https://www.winpcap.org/.
* The ieee80211_radiotap.h header file from David Young

All of these are open source with BSD-style licenses that allow for
unlimited use and royalty-free redistribution within other software
(including commercial/proprietary software). Some include a warranty
disclaimer (relating to the original authors) and require a small
amount of acknowledgment text be added somewhere in the documentation
of any software which includes them (including indirect inclusion
through jNetPcap).

Since Sly Technologies Inc is not the author of this 3rd party code, we
can not waive or modify its software copyright or license.  jNetPcap
users and redistributors must comply with the relevant jNetPcap license
(either the Apache v2 license, free/demo license or a commercial 
jNetPcap OEM license they may have purchased) as well as the minimal 
requirements of this 3rd party open source software.
